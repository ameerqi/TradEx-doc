## 🔄 Payment and Settlement Flow

The Payment and Settlement Flowchart illustrates the steps that occur after the shipment company confirms goods acquisition. It begins with initiating the payment request, checks for authorization via the gateway (e.g., TapPay), and leads to fund release and final settlement. This flow ensures the platform enforces trust by holding payments until shipment confirmation.
